# Metatrader data to  Streamlit

## About the Project

I created this project to transfer Metatrader account information and position data to Streamlit, enabling a live working dashboard. Customize it and use the values you want. To connect Metatrader with Python, I used my previously published method: MQL5-MQL-Python-Socket.
